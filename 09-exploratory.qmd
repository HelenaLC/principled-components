## Convex hulls vs. SDs

```{r}
# simulate bivariate normal with
# increasing n and all else constant
ns <- round(10^seq(2, 5, l = 100))
xy <- lapply(ns, rmvnorm, numeric(2))
# one example...
plot(xy[[50]], cex = 0.5, lwd = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# convex hull areas
as <- mapply(
  xy = xy, ch = lapply(xy, chull),
  \(xy, ch) Polygon(xy[ch, ], TRUE)@area)
# standard deviations
# (assuming x were PC1)
sd <- sapply(xy, \(.) sd(.[, 2]))
```

```{r}
# shifting along y for joint visualization
plot(ns, as, type = "l", ylim = c(0, 80),
  xlab = "# points", ylab = "convex hull area")
# jup, as RG pointed out, these are independent of n
lines(ns, sd+mean(as)/2, col = "blue")
# except for very small scaling by 1/âˆšn seems to work
lines(ns, as/sqrt(ns)+mean(as), col = "red")
```
